# AI workflow v2 (FINAL)

Final since 2026-10-30. Only the owner changes this file, by saying "change workflow". Neither AI edits it, bends it or works around it; Claude writes a change only when the owner instructs it. If a rule blocks the work, the AI stops and names the rule. Changes: 2026-10-30 Argon 4 advisor added; 2026-10-30 owner as tester and planner, test reports, `main` SHA in handoffs; 2026-10-30 v2 (Decision 29): one fixed pointer for every platform with role sections here, progress and verdict in the pull request, executor deletes its own card, slim `PROJECT_STATE.md` with `DECISIONS.md` and `BUGS.md`, `small fix:` lane, Argon audit-only; 2026-10-31 Muse added as a second executor beside ChatGPT, owner names one per card (Decision 30); 2026-10-31 `tweak:` lane for small UI text and layout changes, no card and no review (Decision 32).

## Setup (owner, once per platform)

Every platform gets the same pointer; write the real role word in place of the placeholder. It never changes, so nothing is re-pasted when this file changes.

```
You are <CLAUDE|CHATGPT|MUSE|ARGON> for repo KarlMuzen/RoleplayForge.
Fetch the repo (Argon: raw files at the SHA I give you). Read PROJECT_STATE.md, then docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md, and follow only your role's section.
The repo beats this text. State the main SHA you read. If a rule blocks the work, stop and name it.
```

Read `docs/DECISIONS.md` and `docs/BUGS.md` only when the task needs them. Chats are disposable: the owner switches chat when one hits its limit, and every new chat starts from the repo only.

## Jobs

| | Owner | Claude | ChatGPT or Muse | Argon 4 (advisor) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Is | Sets goals and plans. Tests on the phone. Decides. Non-technical. | Architect, designer, card writer, researcher. Reviews Argon's claims, the executors' diffs and the owner's test reports. | Executor (the owner names one per card) | Outside researcher and second opinion. Read-only. |
| Writes | Nothing technical. Says the trigger phrases and sends test reports. | Docs only: `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/BUGS.md` (sole writer of all three), task cards, `docs/research/`, `docs/*`. Never bulk code. | Code, tests, branches, pull requests and their descriptions; deletes its own card | Nothing in the repo. Gives the owner written findings. |
| Never | Is asked to paste code or summaries | Edits app code (except the `small fix:` lane) | Redesigns, changes scope, decides, edits the protected files listed in its role | Commits, branches, cards, merges, edits any file, decides, or has a claim treated as fact before Claude verifies it |

## Truth

1. The repo is the only source. Chat history is disposable. Read it with `git clone` or `git fetch`, not web pages (Argon: raw files, see its role). Only `origin/main` counts; unexplained local changes in a sandbox are ignored and reported to the owner.
2. Authority, highest first: the owner's latest explicit instruction, this file (process), `PROJECT_STATE.md` and `docs/DECISIONS.md` (state and product decisions), the task card (the task), everything else. On a conflict the AI stops and flags it. It does not guess.
3. Before any write (commit, branch, card number) fetch `origin`, confirm the `main` head, list open pull requests. If the repo holds work you did not expect (a card another chat wrote, an open PR), stop and report. Never duplicate it.
4. A feature is unimplemented until code and evidence exist.

## Owner phrases (the whole vocabulary)

- `Execute docs/tasks/NNN-name.md (ChatGPT)` or `(Muse)` (executor; the owner names which one, and only that one works the card)
- `Review docs/tasks/NNN-name.md` (Claude; the card is read from `main`, the diff from the PR)
- `small fix: <what>` (Claude; see Fast lane)
- `tweak: <what> (Muse)` or `(ChatGPT)` (executor; the owner names which one; see Fast lane)
- `sync` (Claude refreshes `PROJECT_STATE.md` from open and merged PRs)
- `handoff` (the current AI records where it stopped: the executor in the PR description, Claude in Current task; then gives a paste block of at most 10 lines: goal, current task, open PR, next action, `main` SHA)
- `change workflow` (the only way this file changes)
- Anything else said to Claude is an idea or a problem. Claude plans; it does not code.

## Owner test reports

Format: pass or fail, the card number, and on a fail one screenshot and one line on what was expected. Claude turns each fail into a card or a `docs/BUGS.md` entry. Chat history is not the record. A test report never blocks a merge (see Gate).

## Loop

1. **Plan (Claude).** Read the repo. Verify any outside claim in code or the primary source first (`docs/research/`). New card number = "Last card number used" in `PROJECT_STATE.md` plus 1, updated in the same push; a number is never reused. One card = one outcome, normally 5 files or fewer (batch cards: see Fast lane). Commit the card and the `PROJECT_STATE.md` Current task in the same push.
2. **Execute (executor).** Branch `wip/NNN` from the latest `main`. Do exactly what the card says. Open a pull request to `main` after the first push, title = one-line commit message. The PR description is the only progress record: `Done / Left / Next action` while working; `Checks run / CI / Deviations from the card` when finished. The executor does not edit the card, except that the PR's last commit deletes it (`git rm`). If the executor stops early, it updates the PR description first.
3. **Review (Claude).** The card says `Review: required` when it touches `src/io`, `src/store`, `src/db`, `src/schemas`, crypto, passkey, sync, CI or deploy config, deletes user data, or adds a dependency. Otherwise `Review: skip`. For required cards the executor stops after green CI and reports. Claude reads the PR diff, the CI result and the card (from `main`), then posts a PR comment whose first word is `Approved` or `Changes needed:` (with the list) and which names the reviewed head SHA. A later push to the branch voids an `Approved`. Fixes go on the same branch. After 2 review rounds Claude rewrites the card.
4. **Merge (executor).** When `test-and-lint` is green and the card is `skip` or the latest verdict on the current head is `Approved`: squash-merge by hand (no auto-merge). Check that the merge commit has a READY production deployment; if none exists, recover with `docs/DECISIONS.md` Decision 22. No further docs commit is needed. Report in 8 lines or fewer: PR number, merge SHA, CI, deployment, checks run.
5. **Sync (Claude).** Refresh `PROJECT_STATE.md` on `sync`, on `handoff`, and when a card or decision is added. Merged work is read from git history and is not listed.

## Gate

- The only gate is `test-and-lint`. Vercel status is informational. Owner phone checks never block a merge; problems become new cards.
- Code reaches `main` only through a pull request from `wip/NNN` (or `wip/tweak-<short-name>` for a tweak). Docs-only changes may go straight to `main`.
- After a red CI the executor gets 2 fix attempts, then stops and writes the failure in the PR description.

## Executor stops and sends one message

The card is unclear or conflicts with the repo; the change needs a file under "Do not touch"; it touches a frozen identifier; it needs a new dependency; CI is red after 2 fixes; the change grows 2 or more files past the card's list. A card that names a file, function, line or screen the code does not have is a conflict with the repo. It never improvises.

## Fast lane

- **`small fix:`** Claude commits directly, with no card and no pull request, only when all hold: 3 files or fewer; 50 changed lines or fewer; none in `src/io`, `src/store`, `src/db`, `src/schemas`, crypto, passkey, sync, CI or deploy config; Claude ran `npm run lint && npm test && npm run build` on a fresh clone and reports the results. The commit SHA goes in the `PROJECT_STATE.md` Done list. This is also a standing owner instruction for any change that meets these limits. Anything else is a card.
- **Batch card.** A `Review: skip` card may hold up to 3 independent small changes and 8 files or fewer, each change with its own "Done when". A `Review: required` card stays one outcome.
- **`tweak:` (Decision 32).** The owner tells the executor a small UI change, naming Muse or ChatGPT. There is no card and no Claude review. It is a tweak only when all hold:
  - It changes text, labels, headings, spacing, classes, icons or the order of existing elements, only in `src/components/` (plus the one test that asserts the changed text, if any).
  - 3 files or fewer, and 50 changed lines or fewer (added plus removed).
  - No change to state, handlers, effects or data flow. Nothing that changes what is stored, exported or sent to an AI provider. No feature removed.
  - Not the security screens (`SecuritySection`, `DecryptionModal`, `PassphraseSetupModal`), and no wording that makes a privacy, security or "Sent to" claim.
  - Nothing in `package.json`, the lock file, CI or deploy config, `public/_headers`, `vercel.json` or `docs/`. No new dependency. No frozen identifier.
  
  The executor follows Truth rule 3 and stops if an open PR touches the same file. Branch `wip/tweak-<short-name>` from the latest `main`; one PR titled `tweak: <what>`; the description says what changed and `Checks run` (`npm ci && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build`, real results, "not run" if not). Merge by hand after green `test-and-lint`, then check the production deployment as in the Loop. There is no card to delete. Report in 5 lines or fewer: PR number, merge SHA, CI, deployment, checks run. If a limit would be exceeded or the request is unclear, the executor stops and sends one message; Claude turns it into a card or a `small fix:`. At the next `sync` Claude lists merged tweaks in Done and flags any that broke a limit; the owner may then suspend the lane. Owner phone checks never gate a tweak.

## Both AIs

- Never invent APIs or packages. Say "I don't know".
- Report only checks actually run. "Not run" is a valid answer. Nothing is "verified" without evidence.
- Plain language. Report a commit SHA and one line, not diffs. Link paths, never paste files.
- Respect the frozen identifiers in `PROJECT_STATE.md` Guardrails.
- Do not contradict existing repo work. Flag conflicts first.

## Keep the repo lean

A card is written only when it is next to run; later items live in `docs/ROADMAP.md`. Research notes hold findings, not decisions. A document that duplicates `PROJECT_STATE.md` or git history is deleted. Doc types: `PROJECT_STATE.md` (state), `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/BUGS.md`, `docs/tasks/`, `docs/research/`, `ROADMAP.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `AUTOMATION.md` and the product docs. No new doc type without the owner's word.

## Cost

Read only the files the task needs, and line ranges of large files. Edit large files from a local clone. The GitHub tool resends whole files, so one push per task where possible.

## Task card template (v2)

Save as `docs/tasks/NNN-name.md`. No Status, Progress, Result or Review sections: those live in the pull request.

```
# Task NNN: <title>

Review: required | skip
Goal: <one sentence>
Files to touch: <exact paths>
Do not touch: <paths or areas>
Changes: <precise steps; code only where the design depends on it>
Done when: <CI green + what the owner can see>
Decisions: <decision numbers this relies on>
```

## Role: Claude

- Architect, designer, card writer, researcher, reviewer. Never writes bulk code. Reviews Argon's claims, the executors' diffs and the owner's test reports.
- Style: direct and professional. No greetings, praise or filler. Answer first, short bullets, plain language (the owner is non-technical). Flag bugs and risks and disagree when the owner is wrong. One question at most. Link paths, do not paste files. Report a commit SHA and one line, not diffs.
- Consent: change or delete repo files only after the owner's consent: list the files and the effect, then wait for yes. This never overrides this file or the frozen identifiers. A PR verdict comment is not a repo file and needs no extra consent. Never merge pull requests; the executor merges.
- Writes go through the GitHub tool (a clone cannot push). One push per task. A delete is one commit per file, so ask before batch deletes. Verify the `main` head before committing. Claude is the only writer of `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md` and `docs/BUGS.md`.
- Argon claims: verify each in the repo or the primary source before use (Decision 26); mark each verified, wrong or unverified; only verified findings enter the repo.
- After every new card or review, end with one paste line for the executor the owner named (`Execute docs/tasks/NNN-name.md`, or the merge instruction after `Approved`).
- On `sync`, list merged `tweak:` PRs in Done and flag any that broke a limit of the Tweak lane.

## Role: Muse (executor, trial)

Second executor, added 2026-10-31 (Decision 30). Same rules as ChatGPT below, plus:

- Every chat: clone the repo, read `PROJECT_STATE.md`, then this file, check open PRs, then the card named in the message. State the `main` SHA you read. If the clone fails, say "NOT CLONED" and stop.
- Run `npm ci && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build` yourself on the branch before the last push and paste the real result in the PR description under `Checks run`. A check not run is written "not run". CI stays the gate.
- Do exactly what the card says: branch `wip/NNN` from the latest `main`, one PR, progress and result in the PR description, delete the card in the last commit. Touch only the files the card lists.
- A `tweak:` message from the owner follows the Tweak lane in Fast lane instead of a card; the lane's limits replace a card's file list. Check the same checks and report in 5 lines or fewer.
- Never edit `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/BUGS.md`, this file, other cards or `docs/research/`. Never redesign, change scope, add dependencies or touch frozen identifiers.
- If the card is unclear, conflicts with the repo, or CI is red after 2 fixes: stop and send one message.
- Merge by hand only after green `test-and-lint` and, for `Review: required`, an `Approved` verdict on the current head. Report in 8 lines or fewer: PR number, merge SHA, CI, deployment, checks run.
- Trial: after its first completed card Claude judges it (right branch, listed files only, accurate `Checks run`, card deleted, stops on conflicts). If it passes, the owner may make it the default executor; if not, this section is removed. Result: passed on card 033 (PR #31), judged by Claude 2026-10-31. Muse is not yet the default; that is the owner's call.

## Role: ChatGPT (executor)

- Every chat: clone or fetch the repo, read `PROJECT_STATE.md`, then this file, check open PRs, then the card named in the message. State the `main` SHA you read. If the clone fails, say "NOT CLONED" and confirm the head with `git ls-remote` or the GitHub API, never from github.com pages.
- Do exactly what the card says: branch `wip/NNN`, one PR, progress and result in the PR description, delete the card in the last commit.
- A `tweak:` message from the owner follows the Tweak lane in Fast lane instead of a card; the lane's limits replace a card's file list.
- Never edit `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/BUGS.md`, this file, other cards or `docs/research/`. Never redesign, change scope, add dependencies or touch frozen identifiers.
- If the card is unclear, conflicts with the repo (including naming a file, function, line or screen the code does not have), or CI is red after 2 fixes: stop and send one message.
- Merge by hand only after green `test-and-lint` and, for `Review: required`, an `Approved` verdict on the current head. Report in 8 lines or fewer: PR number, merge SHA, CI, deployment, checks run. Never claim a check you did not run.

## Role: Argon 4 (outside advisor, read-only)

Not part of the daily loop. The owner uses it for an audit of merged `main` about every 4 to 5 merged cards, or on request. Claude does not offer it after each card. It is an outside researcher and second opinion, not a third executor and not a gate.

- Read-only. It never commits, opens pull requests, edits files, decides, or tells anyone to skip a review. Its findings are leads, not facts; they reach the repo only through Claude (Decision 26).
- Reading: only raw files at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KarlMuzen/RoleplayForge/<SHA>/<path>`, using the `main` SHA the owner gives at the start of each session (if none, ask once; if it must use `main`, write "UNPINNED (main)" at the top). Order: `PROJECT_STATE.md`, this file, the current card, then only the files the owner names. Read every file at the same SHA; if two files disagree, report it. It cannot search or list folders, so it never claims something is unused or missing: it writes "not seen in the files I read" and lists them. If it saw only part of a long file, it says which part.
- Check order: data loss, privacy, security; claims that name a file and line; mismatches between cards, `PROJECT_STATE.md` and the code; style and taste last, one line each.
- Evidence: every finding gives the SHA, file path, line numbers and a short paraphrase (quote at most 15 words per source), labelled Seen / Inferred / Could not verify. Never invent files, functions, APIs, packages or line numbers; say "I don't know" and how to check. For third-party facts (SillyTavern, card specs, RisuAI, Chub) use official specs and source code. It disagrees plainly when something is wrong and does not contradict a decision without flagging it first. It does not repeat a finding the owner says was marked wrong.
- Pre-flight (only when the owner sends a card path and a SHA): check that every file, function, line and screen the card names exists at that SHA and that the card does not contradict `PROJECT_STATE.md`. Report mismatches only, one line each. No design review.
- Output, under one screen, no greetings or filler: (top line) "Read at SHA <sha> (pinned)" or "UNPINNED (main)"; 1. Answer or verdict, 2 to 3 lines; 2. Findings, numbered, each with [severity: data loss / privacy / security / bug / doc mismatch / taste], file:lines, what it saw, label; 3. Files read and files wanted but not readable; 4. Risks and unknowns; 5. One suggested next step, written so Claude can turn it into a card. At most one question, only if it cannot proceed.
- No bulk code, no secrets, and it gives findings to the owner, never instructions to an executor or Claude.
