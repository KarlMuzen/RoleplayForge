# Architecture

Three diagrams of how RoleplayForge is built. GitHub draws the Mermaid blocks; any AI can read them as text. Edges in diagrams 1 and 2 come from the `import` lines and function calls in `src/` read at `main` `48c6eae` (2026-10-30), except where a note below says otherwise. They are not a full call trace. Device sync was removed by card 034 (PR #32, merge `b2f1afe`), so its boxes and arrows were taken out of diagrams 1 and 2 on 2026-10-31 from `PROJECT_STATE.md`; the restore path was re-read in `src/io/backup.ts` and `src/db/index.ts` on 2026-10-31 (see the open item under diagram 2); the rest was not re-read in `src/` since `48c6eae`. If a diagram and the code disagree, the code wins; fix the diagram.

An editable FigJam copy exists on the owner's Figma board. It is a picture only; this file is the source.

## 1. App layers

No backend. Everything runs in the browser; the only network calls are to the model providers and to Chub (card import by URL). Since Task 028 no file under `src/components` imports the `db` object (a lint rule fails the build if one does), so screens read through the store; services, routing and `src/io` may use the database. Not re-checked since: how Chat and Test Lab save their data.

Notes:
- Free tools live in two places: `src/utils` (older: tokenizer, `writingLint`, `lorebookScan`) and `src/core` (newer: `chatMarkup`, `pasteImport`). Existing files are not moved (`PROJECT_STATE.md` Decision 2).
- `writingLint` is used only by the pre-flight audit modal.

## 2. Data safety

Frozen identifiers (do not rename): DB name `CardCrucibleDB`, settings keys, the `enc.v1.` format and passkey identifiers (`PROJECT_STATE.md` Guardrails). The sync data-channel label went with the code in card 034; no sync identifier remains.

```mermaid

    subgraph inputs ["Ways data enters"]

        restore[/"Restore backup file"/]

    end

        backupOut["Backup file from Settings (API keys optional since Task 027)"]

Checked 2026-10-31 at `main` `12864aa`: `restoreFullBackup` (`src/io/backup.ts`) calls `validateBackupData` first (the schema file itself was not read), then writes cards and lorebooks with `db.cards` and `db.lorebooks` `add` and `update` inside one transaction, so the Dexie hooks (`src/db/index.ts`) run on them. A card the hook rejects is skipped and reported. Hooks exist only on the `cards` and `lorebooks` tables; `connectionProfiles` and `settings` have none. Open (unverified): whether a hook error caught inside the transaction leaves it intact, and whether the restore screen shows the `errors` list. Skipped-without-notice cases are in `docs/BUGS.md`.

## 3. Delivery pipeline

A picture of `docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md`. That file is final and wins on any difference. The dashed `tweak:` arrow is the Decision 32 lane: small UI text or layout changes go from the owner straight to the executor with no card, and with no Claude review they continue like a `Review: skip` card.
